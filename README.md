## My process

For these type of projects, typically I love to design as I go. So a little html there, a little css to go with it immediately so the project slowly comes to life. I draw and color at the same time.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

The major thing I learned in this project is achieving a glassmorphism effect on a card component in HTML using just pure CSS. I faced some bugs with layout and positioning, I had to make some parts of the UI fixed. I used MDN docs extensively while building to really understand the position property and all its options.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would love to achieve a softer look, softer shadows maybe on a white background and a dark themed version as well.
